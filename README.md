# Maze

> The main goal of this project is a maze implementation provided in 2D and 3D visualization. All the project must be developed using C++ and the OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW and GLM libraries. The player should move around the maze avoiding some obstacles like holes, etc, through the keyboard (A,D,S,W).
